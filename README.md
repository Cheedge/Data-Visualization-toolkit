# Data-Visualization-toolkit
In order to keep some data visulization tool kits for analysis during study or just for fun.

As recently attending the N2-Survey project, I found some of ideas will be abandend for some reasons, maybe just not so resonable in the main idea. And this made me to recall the memory before, for a lot of times, some code just not useful for that part, so I just throw it away, but some time later, it makes me regret when I found it seems useful for other problems. And also as a outsider of coding, most of the code I write are not with clear explain or comment, it is really a bad habit.
Therefore, for me, there are three main purpose in this project (maybe expansion later):
1. keep some maybe bad ideas
2. practice data analysis and ploting
3. practice good habit.

The project I think is mainly about data visulization.
